# CodeSee Maps
🤕 Pain: Sophisticated and dense codebases and a lack of shared understanding of how all the code and functionality map to each other.
💡 Solution: CodeSee Maps — a tool for developers to visually map their codebase.
CodeSee Maps provides auto-generated, self-updating code diagrams. They sync your codebase as code evolves so that you can quickly identify cross-code dependencies and navigate between files and folders. It can really improve your understanding of the codebase and guide onboarding, planning, and reviews. The tool is mainly targeted at developers, but it’s of great value for anyone who interacts with the team.
To get started using CodeSee Maps, you will need to authorize CodeSee on your GitHub user account, then install and authorize the CodeSee Architecture Diagrams GitHub action on the repositories you’d like to create maps for. At the moment they only support GitHub, but BitBucket and GitLab are both on the roadmap.

# DeepSource
🤕 Pain: Time-consuming code-reviews prone to a human mistake
💡 Solution: DeepSource — fast and reliable static analysis platform
DeepSource is a static code analyser that can help you with automating the code reviews and save your team a lot of time. It can find issues in the codebase and automatically submit PRs to fix them (and even evaluate incoming code in PRs and fix them too). Supported analyzers include, among others, Docker, Java, JavaScript, Go, Python, Ruby as well as PHP and SQL currently in beta. It integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket (self-hosted is also available).
There is also a possibility to deploy on-premise. How can it improve the way your team works? Their website states that using the tool can save 3.8 hours on an average per developer every week, so you do the math!

# Appsmith
🤕 Pain: The need for numerous CRUD apps within an organisation, which turns out to be a repetitive and often time-consuming task.
💡 Solution: Appsmith — an open-source framework to build internal tools.
Appsmith describes themselves as “The UI Tool for Busy Developers” and it really is that! It’s great for teams that build a lot of internal apps that are hosted inside their own infrastructure and firewall. You can easily build great-looking admin panels, workflows, and dashboards, by dragging and dropping pre-made, customizable widgets. You can integrate with any REST or GraphQL API and use JS or a library to create logic for your app.

# WayScript
🤕 Pain: Setting up internal tooling and applications is time-consuming and keeps developers from the actual problems they are trying to solve.
💡 Solution: WayScript — the fastest way to turn your local code into a hosted app.
WayScript is a development hub for internal tools. It provides pre-configured containers that you can build into so that the code works with your team’s existing infrastructure. You can quickly set up APIs (which traditionally is a long task, but also a must for technical customers), servers, cron tasks, custom inpoints, interfaces, and more. When the tool is ready you can deploy it with one click and send it to your team. You can use it by downloading the local app or via the web application.
